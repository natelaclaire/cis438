## Communication and Response Time

If you send me an email or leave a voicemail during the week, you should expect a response within 1 day. Over the weekend or on holidays, the response time will be longer. If I will be unable to respond for an extended period during the week, I will let students know in advance and will provide an email vacation auto-reply.

Homework that is turned in on time should be graded within 2-3 days. Homework turned in late may take longer for grading.

Any communications sent from my UMA email or from the Brightspace course will go to your @maine.edu address that was automatically created for you when you registered for this class. It will be important that during the semester you check this email regularly for information from your instructors and the institution. This is the email I will use to communicate with you regarding this course.

## Required Text and Materials

_There is no textbook required._ All course materials will be provided within the course Brightspace site.

## Required Software

Students will be provided with access to free Shopify Development Stores, which they will use to complete the tutorials. A Web browser will be required to administer the Shopify Development Stores and access course materials. Students may need graphics and text editing software and free options will be presented in class.

## Course Objectives

The main objectives of the course are:

Individual Learning Activity:

- complete hands-on learning activities to build a gateway site and shopping cart for a pseudo business (My Hobbies site)

Individual Project:

- To select a real or pseudo client with a product or service that lends itself well to marketing and distribution in an online shopping environment.
- To parallel the content covered in the weekly hands-on individual activities using the My Hobbies demonstration site in the client prototype.
- To conduct a usability study of the project prototype.

Expect to work an average of six to nine hours a week on homework assignments, discussion assignments, and studying. This may vary on any particular week depending on class workload.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to

- To select a real or pseudo client with a product or service that lends itself well to marketing and distribution in an online shopping environment.
- To create a storyboard to define the relationship among individual pages in the gateway Web site.
- To parallel the content covered in the weekly hands-on individual activities using the My Travels Site demonstration site in the client prototype
- To conduct a usability study of the project prototype
- To present a Project Documentation Report to highlight the weekly challenges and resolution process in the development of a client prototype

## Electronic Learning Tools

Participation in this course requires that you have access to high speed internet. This is especially critical for accessing online resources.

_Brightspace_ is a content management system that provides the interactive interface for students to access course materials, communicate with instructors and other students, and to upload homework assignments. The Brightspace site includes the syllabus as well as other course materials. If you have technical issues with Brightspace, consult the Student Tech Hub at (207) 621-3123 or <https://uma.edu/thehub>, or contact the UMS IT Helpdesk at 1-800-696-4357.

## Student Responsibilities

Students are responsible for reading the assigned material, performing the activities in the tutorial, and reviewing any supplementary materials available in Brightspace.

Expect to work an average of two to three hours per credit hour each week on class preparation and completion of assigned work in addition to your time spent in class or watching recorded class videos. This may vary on any particular week depending on class workload.

It is the students' responsibility to submit Homework Assignments on or before the due date and complete the Final Project by the last day of the course.

Students may upload late homework assignments for two weeks with a ten–point deduction for each week. After two weeks, the homework assignment will no longer be accepted and a grade of “0” will be posted to the gradebook.

If you miss the final project, you will have an opportunity to make it up only if you have a documented, legitimate excuse and will almost certainly need to request an Incomplete grade.  Otherwise, you will not receive credit for the final project.

## Course Outline

To maximize your learning experience, you should:

- Watch the videos, complete the tutorial using the Tutorial Site along with the instructor, and review any supplementary materials available in Brightspace.
- Communicate with the instructor if there is a concept that you do not understand.
- Complete discussion assignments on or before the due date.
- Indicate that you have completed the tutorial through the Course Content tab in Brightspace on or before the due date.

### Final Project

As a core part of this course, each student will create a Shopify store of their own choosing, applying the concepts learned in the tutorials. This could be a shop for a real or fictitious business.

The topic for your Final Project shop will be due on September 28. The instructor will respond with approval, suggestions, and/or questions before you should begin building the shop. Each student will report on the progress of their Final Project shop twice during the semester and the finalized shop will be due on December 20.

### Religious Holidays

Students may request accommodation for their observance of a religious holiday. Instructors may grant time accommodations such as excusing an absence, rescheduling a project deadline, or adjusting the exam schedule as long as it is deemed reasonable by the instructor. Students who anticipate a conflict must notify their instructor within two weeks of the official start of the academic session to make arrangements. In the case of an internship or clinicals, students should consult course faculty per the program policies as soon as possible.

## Grading Criteria

- **40%** of your grade will be determined by My Hobbies Web Site.
- **20%** of your grade will be determined by Discussion Assignments.
- **40%** of your grade will be determined by Final Project.

A 94-100%, A- 90-93%, B+ 87-89%, B 83-86%, B- 80-82%, C+ 77-79%, C 73-76%, C- 70-72%, D+ 67-69%, D 63-66%, D- 60-62%, F below 60%.

## Communication

Students are encouraged to ask questions or make comments and/or suggestions. This helps you reinforce your learning and maximize your learning experience. The Brightspace content management system is available for student chat discussions, email communication, and to view course announcements at <https://courses.maine.edu/d2l/home>

For purposes of this class, communication is defined as interactively engaging with the Brightspace system, contacting the instructor via email or phone if you have questions outside of class, and responding to the instructor's emails or phone calls.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity means that a student's work is the product of their own effort. Violations of academic integrity include such behaviors as cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, and are described more fully in the UMA Student Academic Integrity Code, which is published in the online UMA Student Handbook. Each student is responsible for learning the standards of academic integrity and ensuring that their work meets these standards. Failure to do so may result in appropriate sanctions consistent with the UMA Student Academic Integrity Policy. If you have questions about the academic integrity of your work, discuss these with your instructor before submitting the work. The full policy can be found at <https://www.uma.edu/compliance/handbook/academic-integrity/>.

### Generative Artificial Intelligence

Students are welcome to use generative artificial intelligence tools (including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and others) for brainstorming, ideation, and producing content for your Final Project site. If you use such tools for the final project or any other assignment, you must include a statement describing how you used it. For example, if you use it for writing the content for your Final Project shop's home page, include in your submission comments:

1. Which tool you used
2. The prompt that you used (what you typed into the tool)
3. A brief explanation of how much of the tool's output you used and how much you changed

## Class Withdrawals

Before withdrawing from a class, students are encouraged to contact the instructor. The instructor may be able to offer an alternative to dropping the class. Ultimately, if a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a class, students must follow school policy. Students who just stop attending a class, but who have not officially withdrawn, will receive a grade based on work completed up until the last date of attendance. Most often, this results in a failing grade. _Students are not automatically withdrawn from a class._

- _L Grade:_ The grade of “L” is awarded if you stop attending, but do not withdraw from the course. The “L” grade is computed into the grade point average as a failing grade and may affect a student’s financial aid eligibility.
- _W Grade:_ The grade of “W”, withdraw, is posted if you drop the course during the first 60% of the semester. A “W” grade is not computed into the grade point average. After the 60% point, the grade of WF may be assigned and may affect a student’s financial aid eligibility.
- _WF Grade:_ The grade awarded when a course is dropped after 60% of the term is completed depends upon your performance up to that point. If you are passing the course the grade of “W” is awarded. If you are failing the course at the time of withdrawal the grade of “WF”, withdraw failing, may be assigned. A “WF” is computed into the grade point average as a failing grade and may affect a student’s financial aid eligibility.

## Incompletes

An “Incomplete” is a temporary grade indicating that specific arrangements have been made with the instructor to complete work by a later date, not to exceed 150 days after the end of the term. If a student has completed almost all of the work for a course, an Incomplete grade may be appropriate. An Incomplete may be extended once by the instructor for a period not to exceed 150 days.

Any additional extension of an incomplete grade by the instructor requires the Dean’s approval.
Awarding of the incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor. If the incomplete grade is determined to be appropriate, the instructor will complete the Incomplete Grade Contract in MaineStreet, which specifies the following:

- The work to be completed by the student.
- The date by which the student will complete the work, not to exceed 150 days after the end of the term.
- The grade the student will receive if the work is not completed. If no grade is specified, the Incomplete is converted to an “F” after 150 days or as specified by the contract.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Contact Academic Success to discuss possible assistance. Accommodations must be requested each semester, and are not provided retroactively.
