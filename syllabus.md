## Electronic Learning Tools

Participation in this course requires that you have access to high speed internet. This is especially critical for accessing online resources.

*Brightspace* is a content management system that provides the interactive interface for students to access course materials, communicate with instructors and other students, and to upload homework assignments. The Brightspace site includes the syllabus as well as other course materials. If you have technical issues with Brightspace, consult the Student Tech Hub at (207) 621-3123 or <https://uma.edu/thehub>, or contact the UMS IT Helpdesk at 1-800-696-4357.

*a ten (10) -point deduction for each week*

After two weeks, the homework/discussion assignment will no longer be accepted and a grade of "0" will be posted to the gradebook.

Graded assignments are due on Saturday at midnight of the week they are assigned. Assignments are graded on the following Sunday or Monday. Students should review feedback before starting the next assignment.

### Semester-long Project: Your Portfolio Site

As a core part of this course, each student will create a WordPress Web site of their own choosing, applying the concepts learned in the tutorials. This could be a Web site for a real or fictitious business or non-profit, a personal Web site, or an informative Web site on a topic of your choosing - and if you have another idea that doesn't fit into one of those categories, that will probably work as well! Just keep in mind when selecting a Portfolio Site that by the end of the course your Portfolio Site will need to include multiple pages, an image gallery, blog/news posts with multiple categorizations, a contact form, a calendar, a map, a forum, and a shop.

One of the first week's assignments is to propose the topic for your Portfolio Site. The instructor will respond with approval, suggestions, and/or questions before you should begin building the Portfolio Site.

### Religious Holidays

Students who anticipate a conflict between their observance of a religious holiday and an academic requirement in this course should contact me early in the semester to discuss the conflict. Reasonable efforts will be made to minimize any negative academic impact that may arise due to the conflict.

## Grading Criteria

- **40%** of your grade will be determined by My Hobbies Web Site.
- **20%** of your grade will be determined by Discussion Assignments.
- **40%** of your grade will be determined by Parallel Site.

A 94-100%, A- 90-93%, B+ 87-89%, B 83-86%, B- 80-82%, C+ 77-79%, C 73-76%, C- 70-72%, D+ 67-69%, D 63-66%, D- 60-62%, F below 60%.

## Communication

Students are encouraged to ask questions or make comments and/or suggestions. This helps you reinforce your learning and maximize your learning experience. The Brightspace content management system is available for student chat discussions, email communication, and to view course announcements at <https://courses.maine.edu/d2l/home>

For purposes of this class, communication is defined as interactively engaging with the Brightspace system, contacting the instructor via email or phone if you have questions outside of class, and responding to the instructor's emails or phone calls.

Any communications sent from my UMA email or from the Brightspace course will go to your @maine.edu address that was automatically created for you when you registered for this class. It will be important that during the semester you check this email regularly for information from your instructors and the institution. This is the email I will use to communicate with you regarding this course.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity means that a student's work is the product of his/her own effort. Violations of academic integrity include such behaviors as cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, and are described more fully in the UMA Student Academic Integrity Code, which is published in the online UMA Student Handbook. Each student is responsible for learning the standards of academic integrity, and ensuring that his/her work meets these standards. Failure to do so may result in appropriate sanctions consistent with UMA Student Academic Integrity Policy.  If you have questions about the academic integrity of your work, discuss these with your instructor before submitting the work.  The full policy can be found at <https://www.uma.edu/compliance/handbook/academic-integrity/>.

## Class Withdrawals

Before withdrawing from a class, students are encouraged to contact the instructor. The instructor may be able to offer an alternative to dropping the class. Ultimately, if a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a class, students must follow school policy. Students who just stop attending a class, but who have not officially withdrawn, will receive a grade based on work completed up until the last date of attendance. Most often, this results in a failing grade. *Students are not automatically withdrawn from a class.*

L Grade: The grade of "L" is awarded if you stop attending, but do not withdraw from the course. The "L" grade is computed into the grade point average as a failing grade.

W Grade: The grade of "W", withdraw, is posted if you drop the course during the first 60% of the semester. A "W" grade is not computed into the grade point average. After the 60% point, the grade of WF may be assigned.

WF Grade: The "WF" grade is awarded when a course is dropped after 60% of the term is completed and depends upon your performance up to that point. If you are passing the course the grade of "W" is awarded. If you are failing the course at the time of withdrawal the grade of "WF", withdraw failing, may be assigned. A "WF" is computed into the grade point average as a failing grade.

## Incompletes

An "Incomplete" is a temporary grade indicating that specific arrangements have been made with the instructor to complete work by a later date, not to exceed 150 days after the end of the term.  If a student has completed almost all of the work for a course, an Incomplete grade may be appropriate. An Incomplete may be extended once by the instructor for a period not to exceed 150 days.  Any additional extension of an Incomplete grade by the instructor requires the Dean's approval.

Awarding of the incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor.  If the Incomplete grade is determined to be appropriate, the instructor will complete the Incomplete Grade Contract in MaineStreet, which specifies the following:

- The work to be completed by the student.
- The date by which the student will complete the work, not to exceed 150 days after the end of the term.
- The grade the student will receive if the work is not completed.  If no grade is specified, the Incomplete is turned to an "F" after 150 days or as specified by the contract.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability which may affect your ability to participate fully in this course, it is your responsibility to request accommodations promptly.  Contact the Department of Student Support and Development to discuss possible assistance.  Accommodations must be requested each semester, and are not provided retroactively.  More information can be found at: <http://www.uma.edu/academics/student-support/student-development/disability-services/>.
