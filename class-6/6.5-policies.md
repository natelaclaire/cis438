# 6.5 Policies

Policies help protect our businesses, provide assurance to customers, and help us comply with regulations. As we briefly saw in the customer accounts tutorial, Shopify provides space for you to enter your policies so that Shopify can include their details in various appropriate places and so that you can add their links to your navigation menu(s). In this tutorial, we're going to explore this area more and set up our policies.

1. Log into your _My Hobbies Shop_ admin area by going to [https://admin.shopify.com/].
2. Click _Settings_.
3. Click _Policies_.
4. We've already covered the _Return rules_ section, so let's skip right to _Written policies_.
5. First we have our _Return and refund policy_. No policy is set at the moment. Let's click it and add one.
6. For each policy, Shopify provides a template. If you already have your own policy, you would copy and paste it into this box. Otherwise, you can click _Insert template_ to generate a policy that you then need to review and modify as needed. If you click the _disclaimer_ link, Shopify includes a disclaimer informing you that you need to review the template with a licensed attorney. Since this is purely for academic purposes, we're going to use the template as-is, but I implore you to always review any policy or license agreement with a licensed attorney. Click _Insert template_.
7. We have a full WYSIWYG HTML editor and should review the policy to ensure that everything is formatted appropriately and that any blanks are filled in. For example, you would replace _[INSERT RETURN ADDRESS]_ with your shop's address.
8. You also need to review the text to ensure that it covers everything. For example, since we have enabled self-serve returns, we would probably need to add something about that to the paragraph that begins, _To start a return_. Perhaps you might add _or initiate a return from your account on our Web site_ after the email address.
9. Once you are happy with the result, click _Publish_.
10. Next, click _Privacy policy_.
11. Shopify provides an automated privacy policy that stays in sync with your shop settings and templates. This is nice since it ensures that any changes to settings or how Shopify works that would impact the privacy policy get reflected in the policy; however, remember that you are still responsible for the policy and need to have an attorney review it, understand your obligations under it, and monitor it for changes.
12. Alternately, you can turn off the automated policy, which gives you more control but also places a larger burden on you to ensure that anytime you change settings that will impact the policy you return to the policy and make the necessary adjustments.
13. We'll stick with the automated policy and click _Publish_.
14. Next, click _Terms of service_.
15. Click _Insert template_.
16. Note that there are several blanks that need to be filled in, including business details and links to a few other supporting policies. Shopify has a [help center document that includes the links to your shop's policies](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/refund-privacy-tos#add-links-to-your-policies-within-pages-or-on-social-media). Let's add a link to our privacy policy. Scroll down to section 10 and remove _[LINK TO PRIVACY POLICY]_. Replace it with _https://_ followed by the domain name for your shop followed by _/policies/privacy-policy_, which we can copy from the help document. Then highlight the URL, copy it, click _Insert link_, and paste the URL in the _Link to_ box.
17. Change _Open this link in_ to _a new window_ and enter _privacy policy_ as the _Link title_.
18. Click _Insert link_.
19. Of course, you would need to carefully review everything, replacing values as needed, and get a legal review of the document, but for now we'll just click _Publish_.
20. Click _Shipping policy_.
21. There is no shipping policy template, but it's an important policy to provide in order to inform your customers of things like order processing and shipping times, shipping costs, and other shipping-related information. Shopify has a [YouTube video that includes advice for what to include in the various policies, inluding the shipping policy](https://youtu.be/hyaKIKb22cw?si=kaRaojBbWKIAZaKk&t=190) as well as a [blog post that includes a downloadable shipping policy template](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shipping-policy#).
22. For now, we'll click _Cancel_.
23. Click _Contact information_.
24. Click _Insert template_.
25. Here you would need to provide any necessary contact details. For now, just click _Publish_.
26. Last, click _Purchase Options Cancellation Policy._
27. Click _Insert template_.
28. This particular policy is largely irrelevant to our shop, since we don't offer subscriptions or try before you buy. We may have pre-orders, though. Delete the _Subscriptions_ section and the _Try before you buy_ section, adjust the first sentence, and then click _Publish_.
29. Let's take a look at how these appear on the checkout page. Click _Checkout_ on the menu.
30. Click the elipsis next to our live configuration and click _View_.
31. At the bottom of the page, you can see the policies listed. Notice that they open in a modal when clicked, so the customer remains on the checkout page.
32. Finally, let's make sure that the links appear on the main shop page.
33. Close the preview and the _Settings_ page.
34. Click _Online store_ and then _View your store_.
35. Scroll down to the bottom and see the links to the policies. These links take you to the policy pages rather than modals.

That's it! You've set up your policies. In the next tutorial, we'll talk about some Shopify settings related to customer privacy.
