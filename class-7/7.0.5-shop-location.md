# 7.0.5 Shop Location

I made a mistake! When we were setting up shipping, we should have added the address to our shop location. Before we can start testing orders, we need to do that. Here's how:

1. Log into your _My Hobbies Shop_ admin area by going to <https://admin.shopify.com/>.
2. Click _Settings_ and then _Locations_.
3. Click _Shop Location_.
4. Click _Add_ next to _Address_.
5. Supply an address for your shop. Remember that in order to test local delivery, this should be in close proximity to an address that you will use for some testing.
6. Click _Save_.
7. Click _Save_.
