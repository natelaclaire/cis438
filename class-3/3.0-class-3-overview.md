# 3.0 Class 3 Overview

This week, we’re focusing on themes—customizing and setting up your shop itself.

So far, we’ve covered products and how to organize them. Now, it’s time to look at the bigger picture: the design and structure of your site. We’ll cover how to choose a theme, how themes work in Shopify, and how to customize them. That includes updating your site header—like adding your logo—adjusting colors, and creating a consistent look and feel.

We’ll also go beyond products and talk about adding other types of content. You’ll learn how to set up blog posts, create pages, and manage your site navigation. Navigation can include links to collections, pages, and even individual products if you want.

For Tutorial Five, I’ve attached a couple of Word documents, and a JPEG image. You’ll need those files for this week’s work. PDFs of the tutorials are available as well, in case you’d like something to reference alongside the videos.

Our discussion topic this week is logos. A logo is one of the most important parts of your brand. I’d like you to spend a little time researching what makes a good logo and what to consider when designing one. If you already know what kind of shop you’ll be building for your final project, focus your research on that. If not, just keep it general to e-commerce stores. Write a short summary—just a paragraph or two—and include the references you used, and post it to Brightspace.

One more important deadline: along with this week’s assignments, your final project topic is due on September 27. You’ll need to choose a real or fictitious business for your project and send me the name, a short description, and the types of products it will sell. I’ll review it, send you feedback or suggestions, and once approved, I’ll set up a new blank Shopify store just for your project. You’ll continue to use the “My Hobbies” shop for tutorials, but the new store will be where you build your final project.

Once you’ve got approval, you can dive right in—start adding products, customizing your theme, and putting everything together. Each week, you’ll build on what you learn to improve your final site.

If you have questions, please reach out. Good luck this week, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with!
