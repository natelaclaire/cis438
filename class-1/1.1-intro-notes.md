# 1.1 Introduction

Hello! Welcome to CIS 438! My name is Nate LaClaire and I am a professional Web developer with over 25 years of experience. Over the years, I've built numerous ecommerce sites using various ecommerce and content management systems, as well as a few with custom-built ecommerce solutions. Although there are many, many ways to build an online storefront, one of the most popular ecommerce platforms is Shopify, which will be the focus of this course.

I am looking forward to sharing what I have learned and learning new things from you and alongside you!

Let's take a look at the Syllabus together.
