# 1.1 *Class Introduction*

Hello, and welcome to **CIS 438: Electronic Commerce**!

My name is **Nate LaClaire**, and I’m a professional web developer with over 25 years of experience. Over the years, I’ve built numerous e-commerce sites using a variety of platforms, including content management systems and even some fully custom solutions.

Although there are many ways to build an online storefront, one of the most popular platforms today is **Shopify**—and that’s what we’ll be using as the focus of this course. I’m excited to share what I’ve learned with you, and I’m equally excited to learn from you as we go along.

## Course Format

This is a fully **online, asynchronous course**. That means you can complete the lessons on your own schedule—there are no required live meetings. Each week, you’ll find a set of recorded videos and tutorials in **Brightspace**, along with assignments and discussion prompts.

While I don’t have set office hours, my schedule is very flexible. You can email me, call me, or use the “Make an Appointment” link in Brightspace to book a time that works for you. If you reach out during the week, you can usually expect a response within one business day. On weekends or holidays, my replies may take a little longer. If I’ll be unavailable for an extended period, I’ll let you know in advance and set up an email auto-reply.

## Communication & Grading

* **Email:** Please check your `@maine.edu` email regularly, since that’s where all course communications will go.
* **Homework:** Assignments submitted on time are typically graded within 2–3 days. Late work may take longer and will incur a **10-point deduction per week**.
* **Deadlines:** All assignments are due **Saturdays at 11:59 p.m.** If you see a due date listed that isn’t on a Saturday, let me know—that’s a mistake.
* **Final Project:** If you miss the final project deadline, you’ll need a documented legitimate excuse and may have to request an **Incomplete**.

## Materials

There is **no textbook required**. All materials are provided in Brightspace. You’ll also receive access to a free **Shopify Development Store**, which you’ll use for your tutorials and project work. A web browser is all you need to get started, though some tasks may be easier on a laptop or desktop. Later in the semester, you may also need graphics or text editing tools, and I’ll recommend some free options.

## Course Structure & Expectations

* Each week, you’ll watch video tutorials and then complete hands-on activities in your Shopify store.
* You’ll participate in **discussion assignments**, which are due weekly.
* You’ll complete a **Final Project**, where you’ll build your own Shopify site for a real or fictitious business. You’ll propose your topic in Week 4, submit progress reports in Weeks 7 and 11, and the final version will be due in Week 15.
* Grading Breakdown:
  * 40% – Weekly tutorials (“My Hobbies” site)
  * 20% – Discussion assignments
  * 40% – Final Project

If a concept isn’t clear, please reach out. My goal is for you to **understand and apply** what we’re learning, and I can only help if I know where you’re stuck.

## Academic Integrity & AI Tools

Academic integrity is very important. All work should reflect your own effort. That said, you **are welcome to use generative AI tools**—like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini—for brainstorming, ideation, or even creating content for your final project. If you do, you must include a brief statement in your submission that explains:

1. Which tool you used
2. What prompt you gave it
3. How much of the output you used and how much you modified

I want to emphasize that the key learning outcome is your ability to **apply** e-commerce tools—not just to generate text. For example, the wording on your homepage is less critical than your ability to design, configure, and publish that page in Shopify. On the other hand, I strongly encourage you to write your **discussion posts** yourself, since those are where your personal engagement and insights matter most.

## Final Notes

The syllabus also contains important information on policies around incomplete grades, withdrawals, accommodations, and Title IX. Please take time to review it carefully.

I hope this overview gives you a good sense of how the course will run. I’m looking forward to working with you this semester. Please reach out if you have any questions as you review the syllabus or start the course materials.

Thanks, and let’s get started!
